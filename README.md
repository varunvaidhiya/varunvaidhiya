**RecentProject: Leveraging Foundation Models for Autonomous Vehicles** (Dec '23 - oct '24)

This project explores the potential of Foundation Models (LLMs) for various tasks in autonomous vehicles, including perception, planning, and Natural Language Interaction. I'm investigating techniques like Prompt Engineering, Fine-tuning, Knowledge Distillation, and model compression for efficient deployment on edge devices.
