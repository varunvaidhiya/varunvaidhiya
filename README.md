**Current Project: Leveraging Foundation Models for Autonomous Vehicles** (Dec '23 - Present)

This project explores the potential of Foundation Models (LLMs) for various tasks in autonomous vehicles, including perception, planning, and Natural Language Interaction. I'm investigating techniques like Prompt Engineering, Fine-tuning, Knowledge Distillation, and model compression for efficient deployment on edge devices.

**Additional Information:**

* Explore the code in the `src` directory.
* Find data processing scripts and configurations in the `data` and `configs` directories, respectively.
* Refer to the `notebooks` directory for exploratory analysis and visualizations.
* Tests for different modules are located in the `tests` directory.
